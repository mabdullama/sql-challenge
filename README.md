Background

I have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. The purpose of this project is designing the tables that hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. Then Iâ€™ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

Data Engineering

This project includes a data modeling phase where we design the database structure and relationships using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). The ERD provides a visual representation of the database schema, showing the entities (tables) and their relationships.
The ERD model, generated using Quick DBD, illustrates the relationships and attributes of the entities in our database. It serves as a reference for developers, database administrators, and other stakeholders involved in the project.
